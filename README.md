# ðŸŸ£ Dashboard Icons Browser

This is just a very simple web application for searching the icons from the [walkxcode/dashboard-icons](https://github.com/walkxcode/dashboard-icons) project. I made this to help me to edit the icon in my [homepage](https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage) yaml file, Ctrl+F the repo directory is not really a nice experience.
